# AI Sauces

Decided it to be fun to utilize ChatGPT and some Dalle services to generate my own random hot sauces. Back story on the first one: I randomly grow peppers and tomatoes - pretty easy to grow in southern VA. This year with the newer addition of ChatGPT I decided to partner with it and create a hot sauce. In the spring of 2023 I planted Jalapenos, Ghost Peppers, Banana Peppers, Sweet Cubanelle's, green peppers, cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and some Cherokee purple tomatoes.

As I bottled my first batch I figured it would be fun to for the internet to contribute!
